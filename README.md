# Flood-Detection-from-Images-using-Deep-Learning

NOTE: This code was inspired and modified from the following source: https://deeplizard.com/.

"Flooding" images were collected by authors of the paper named "Detecting floodwater on roadways from image data with handcrafted features and deep transfer learning*", available at "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00125.pdf".

"No Flooding" images were collected from an automated google image search script.

Flood Detection Model can be downloaded from the follwing link:

The trained model performed quite impressively and got an accuracy score of over 98% and it was only trained for about 5 minutes.
